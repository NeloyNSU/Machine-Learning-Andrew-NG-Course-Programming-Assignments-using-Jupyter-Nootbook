# Machine-Learning-Andrew-NG-Course-Programming-Assignments-using-Jupyter-Nootbook
This repository contains machine learning algorithms and exercises implemented by me entirely from scratch using Jupyter Notebook.

I've Finished Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, hopefully I will be able to make it to the end and upload everything I learned in the course here!!! Another Repository will be created for Matlab and Octave implementation.
